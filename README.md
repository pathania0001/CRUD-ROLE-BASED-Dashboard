# **SecureTaskGuard**  

SecureTaskGuard is a **role-based task management dashboard** designed for administrators to create users, assign tasks, and define custom permissions. Built with **React** and **Firebase**, this system ensures that users can only access and modify fields based on the permissions granted by the admin. The project demonstrates a strong implementation of **authorization, role-based access control (RBAC), and secure data handling**, making it an ideal solution for controlled task management.
