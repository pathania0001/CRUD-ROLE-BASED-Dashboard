# React + Vite

SecureTaskGuard::

SecureTaskGuard is a role-based task management dashboard designed for administrators to create users, assign tasks, and define custom permissions. Built with React and Firebase, this system ensures that users can only access and modify fields based on the permissions granted by the admin. The project demonstrates a strong implementation of authorization, role-based access control (RBAC), and secure data handling, making it an ideal solution for controlled task management.

Key Features
Admin Control Panel: Create users, assign tasks, and configure role-based permissions.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Users see only their assigned tasks and can edit only permitted fields.
Secure Authentication & Authorization: Firebase Authentication ensures a secure login system.
Real-Time Database Management: Dynamic updates using Firebase Firestore for seamless task handling.
Granular Permission System: Fine-tuned access control at the field level to ensure data integrity.
Tech Stack Used
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS (for styling)
Backend & Database: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Rules for RBAC)
Authentication: Firebase Authentication (Email/Password, OAuth)
State Management: React Context API / Redux (if applicable)
